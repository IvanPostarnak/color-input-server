*things to do, things to get back to, and problems to solve and prevent*
----
- [ ] Activate log-counter : it is created at 'serverLog/helpers/' but is not require() by anything (22.03.2023)
- [ ] look up for server's architecture and restructure project according it (at least folder's architecture - names etc) (24.03.2023)
- [ ] transfer 'Allow'-headers-related values from .env file to constants/serverConstants.js (because, it is not about environment) (24.03.2023)
- [ ] create sqlDatabase/ module using PostgreSQL (we cannot save our data using txt forever =)
